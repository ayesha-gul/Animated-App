                       <p>
                       In the coming year we will release what we're currently calling Syscoin NEVM (Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine). <br/>
                        This will not be your typical EVM blockchain. Our network will use parallel processing to enable 
                        projects to access <br/> much more processing power than Ethereum. Meaning bigger programs, more complex calculations,
                         and thousands <br/> more simultaneous calculations, 
                       all executed at far lower fees than Ethereum.
                       </p>
